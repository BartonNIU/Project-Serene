                                        <p>Children’s behaviour can be disruptive and difficult at times. For some children, serious behaviour difficulties become a pattern that can include acting impulsively, reacting with aggression, refusing to follow reasonable directions, and defying adult authority. These behaviour difficulties interfere with children’s social and academic development and can have serious consequences for their mental health.</p>

It is characterized by aggression and, sometimes, law-breaking activities. Early intervention and treatment is important, since children with untreated CD are at increased risk of developing a range of problems during their adult years including substance use, personality disorders and mental illnesses.</p>

                                        <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a particular condition that affects a young child’s behaviour or development (learning). Many children with ADHD say they do not understand why they sometimes feel out of control or very lonely. ADHD is not the child’s fault. We do not know exactly what causes ADHD. ADHD is a behavioural disorder, not an illness or a sign of low intelligence. With understanding, care and medical treatment, a child who has ADHD can lead a normal life. </p>

                                        <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects a person’s ability to interact with the world around them. ASD has wide-ranging levels of severity and varying characteristics. No two people on the autism spectrum are alike. ASD is a neuro-developmental disability thought to have neurological or genetic causes (or both). However, the cause is not yet fully understood and there is no cure. A person on the autism spectrum has difficulties in some areas of their development, but other skills may develop typically.</p>

                                                •	play – isolated, repetitive, a preference for predictable play, difficulty with imaginative play, such as pretending that a box is a boat or a stick is a horse <br><br>
                                                •	body movements – stereotypical behaviour, such as flapping and toe walking, and other behaviours that may cause self-injury, such as hand biting <br><br>

                                                •	rituals and routines – these bring some order to chaos and confusion. A change to routine can result in the person displaying high levels of stress, anxiety or acting out <br><br>
                                                •	tantrums – can be a way to express extreme confusion, stress, anxiety, anger and frustration when unable to express their emotions in another way <br><br>
                                                •	sensory processing differences – difficulties processing certain sounds, colours, tastes, smells and textures. People may seek and avoid particular sensations. Some people will have difficulty with discriminating sensory information too, for example hot versus cold.

Demands change from situation to situation and when children are unsure of what they are supposed to be doing, they’re more likely to misbehave. <br><br>
                                            •	Calling things out from a distance: Be sure to tell children important instructions face-to-face. Things yelled from a distance are less likely to be remembered and understood.<br><br>
                                            •	Transitioning without warning: Transitions can be hard for kids, especially in the middle of something they are enjoying. Having warning gives children the chance to find a good stopping place for an activity and makes the transition less fraught.<br><br>
                                            •	Asking rapid-fire questions, or giving a series of instructions: Delivering a series of questions or instructions at children limits the likelihood that they will hear, answer questions, remember the tasks, and do what they’ve been instructed to do.

                                            <p>A child with ADHD can stretch the patience of all members of the family. Parents need to try a range of different ways to help their child learn and develop, and reduce stress in the family. It is important for parents to be consistent and work as a team to support each other. Try to have breaks often, as it is valuable to get some respite from the demands of caring for a child with ADHD. It will help if you: <br><br>
                                                •	Develop consistent routines at home and at school.<br><br>
                                                •	Keep rules clear and simple and give reminders calmly.<br><br>
                                                •	Get physically close to the child and make sure you have the child’s full attention when you talk.<br><br>
                                                •	Give your child only one or two instructions at a time.<br><br>
                                                •	Ask them to repeat the instruction to be sure that they have understood.<br><br>
                                                •	Praise your child when they are behaving appropriately and acknowledge their achievements.<br><br>
                                                •	Be clear about discipline for behaviour you find unacceptable. For example, use ‘time out’ (between the ages of 18 months and six years) or logical consequences (for older children).

Having a child on the autism spectrum can have a significant effect on parents, who may react to the diagnosis in a variety of ways, including relief, shock, grief, anger and guilt. Feelings of stress, confusion and anxiety are also common in parents who are caring for a child on the autism spectrum. It can be valuable for parents to consider joining a support group or participating in counselling.</p>

                                            <p>Be aware of the situation: Consider and manage environmental and emotional factors; hunger, fatigue, anxiety or distractions can all make it much more difficult for children to reign in their behavior. <br><br>
                                            Adjust the environment: When it’s homework time, for instance, remove distractions like video screens and toys, provide a snacks, establish an organized place for kids to work and make sure to schedule some breaks — attention isn’t infinite.<br><br>
                                            Make expectations clear: You’ll get better cooperation if both you and your child are clear on what’s expected. Sit down with him and present the information verbally. Even if he “should” know what is expected, clarifying expectations at the outset of a task helps head off misunderstandings down the line.<br><br>
                                            Provide countdowns for transitions: Whenever possible, prepare children for an upcoming transition. Let them know when there are, say, 10 minutes remaining before they must come to dinner or start their homework. Then, remind them, when there are say, 2 minutes, left. Just as important as issuing the countdown is actually making the transition at the stated time.<br><br>
                                            Let kids have a choice: As kids grow up, it’s important they have a say in their own scheduling. Giving a structured choice — “Do you want to take a shower after dinner or before?” — can help them feel empowered and encourage them to become more self-regulating.
